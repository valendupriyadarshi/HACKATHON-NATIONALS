the "start-up" launchepad
THE OPPORTUNITY 
we live in an age where innovation is democratized .anyone ca have a world changingh idea,and millions of peoples posses the micro-skills , p[assions ,or spare time to help those to life .the barrier etween "founder" and "supporter"is ready to dissolved.
REQUIRED FEATURES:
A.The "venture" directory (discovery and details ):
The gallery:the landing page must be a visual grid displaying active startups.Each card shows the logo ,startup name ,and area of work (e.g. "fintech","green energy").
the deep dive :when a user clicks a card,it expands into detailed "venture profile".
 identity:display the founder's bio and the vision statement.
open post: a dedicated section listing current6 needs -weather iot's a " vaccancy " for a co-founder or a specific "pronlem " they need solving (e.g. "need feedback on this UI").
B.THE "momentum"(update and activity):

AI moderator: in feed ,there is a high risk og bullying ,abbusive language,or inappropriate post or comments. integrate a text -analysis AI that can scans every bost before it is published 
HOW IT SHOULD WORK :
1.INPUT:a user types a status updat e:"rohan is a loser and fails every exam ".
2.AI ANALYSIS (sentiment and toxicity check): the system runs the text through a sentiment analysis engine (like textblob etc ).
3.THE TRIGGER: 
a.) if sentiment score is negative (e.g. , -0.8)or if it detects toxic keywords,the app blocks the post immediately
b.) usrer feedback:the app displays a warning :"hold on! This post looks inappropriate ."
4. THE "'GOOD" PATH: if the students type "congratulations rohan!"(positive score), the post is publishe instantly.
