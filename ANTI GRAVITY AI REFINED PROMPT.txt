The website’s primary objective is to **[CLEAR OBJECTIVE / REFINED PROBLEM STATEMENT]** for **[TARGET USERS]**, achieved through **[CORE SOLUTION IDEA]**.

You are provided with:

* Existing **code files**
* **UI screenshots**
* **feature research**
* **data sources**
* a defined **UI theme, color palette, and icon pack**

All provided resources **must be used and refined**, not replaced.

* Preserving business logic and features
* Refining UI/UX quality
* Ensuring production-grade structure, performance, and clarity

---

### **Scope & Task**

Using the codebase and UI assets located in **[FOLDER NAME]**, you must:

1. **Build and refine the website**, including the landing page
2. **Preserve all existing features** and logic
3. **Implement all non-negotiable features** listed below
4. **Visually refine** existing UI components and animations (do not redesign from scratch)

#### **Non-Negotiable Features**

* [CORE FEATURES]
* [EXTRA FEATURES]

### **Process Requirement (Critical)**

Before creating an implementation plan **or writing any code**, you must:

1. **List all assumptions**
2. **Identify missing or ambiguous information**
3. **Ask clarifying questions**, including but not limited to:

   * Target device priority (mobile vs desktop)
   * Expected animation intensity
   * Performance vs visual fidelity tradeoffs
   * Deployment expectations (if any)

⚠️ **Do not proceed until all questions are answered.**

---

### **Expected Output (After Clarification)**

Once all ambiguities are resolved, provide:

1. A **clear development plan**
2. A **refinement strategy** (UI, UX, performance)
3. A **technology and folder structure breakdown**
4. Then proceed with **implementation** and coding of the whole project
