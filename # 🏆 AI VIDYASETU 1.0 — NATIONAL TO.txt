---

## P — PROCESS (NON-NEGOTIABLE WORKFLOW)

### 🔴 RULE 0 — NO ASSUMPTIONS

Before proceeding, **ask clarifying questions** if **any requirement is unclear**.
Do **not** guess features, users, or constraints.

---

## PHASE 1 — RESEARCH & PLANNING (MANDATORY)

🚨 **You may NOT write production code until Phase 1 is 100% complete.**

### Your Output for Phase 1

Create a **single, complete `RESEARCH.md`** that acts as a **build-ready blueprint**.

---

### STEP 1 — Problem Deconstruction

Ask yourself:

* What is the *actual* problem (not the surface description)?
* Who benefits most from solving it?
* What are **mandatory vs optional** features?
* What does *failure* look like?

**Document:**

* Core Problem (1–2 lines)
* Target Users (role, context, device, tech level)
* Mandatory Features
* Optional Enhancements
* Success Metrics (judge + user)

---

### STEP 2 — Real-World Validation (India Context)

Research and validate the problem using **real data**.

**Document:**

* 3–5 data.gov.in or credible datasets (with relevance)
* At least 1 related government initiative
* Key statistics that justify the problem
* Where this data will appear:

  * UI
  * Demo narration

---

### STEP 3 — User Persona & Know-Your-User

Define **one primary persona**.

**Document:**

* Who they are
* Where/when they use the product
* Primary goal
* Current pain points
* Device priority (mobile/desktop)
* UX implications

---

### STEP 4 — UI / UX Strategy (Decision-Driven)

Decide — don’t decorate.

Ask:

* What emotion must the UI evoke? (Trust, urgency, clarity, authority?)
* Which reference philosophy fits best (Linear, Apple, etc.) — *and why*?
* What information must appear **first, second, last**?

**Document:**

* Design personality & rationale
* Layout strategy (dashboard, map-first, etc.)
* Navigation model
* Information hierarchy
* Landing page flow (attention → proof → action)

---

### STEP 5 — API & Data Strategy

For **each API**, define:

* Purpose
* Data freshness needs
* India coverage
* Failure fallback

**Document:**

* API → Feature mapping
* Real-time vs cached data
* Cache duration
* Error & fallback UX
* Performance targets

---

### STEP 6 — Feature Architecture

Create a **tiered feature map**.

**Document:**

* **Tier 1:** Mandatory (must work perfectly)
* **Tier 2:** 1–2 innovative differentiators
* **Tier 3:** Polish (only if time permits)
* Explicitly list **features you will NOT build** (with reasons)

---

### STEP 7 — Technical Architecture

Plan the build **before coding**.

**Document:**

* Folder structure (with purpose)
* Component architecture
* Shared vs page components
* API clients
* TypeScript models
* Global patterns:

  * Error handling
  * Loading states
  * Caching
* Development order

---

### STEP 8 — Self-Validation Gate

Before moving on, answer **YES** to all:

* Can another engineer build this from `RESEARCH.md` alone?
* Are all UX, data, and technical decisions finalized?
* Is there zero ambiguity left?

If **NO**, refine.
If **YES**, proceed.

---

## PHASE 2 — IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### Code Standards (Strict)

* ✅ TypeScript everywhere
* ✅ Complete files only (no TODOs, no placeholders)
* ✅ One file at a time, fully implemented
* ✅ Error handling + loading states everywhere
* ✅ API caching mandatory
* ✅ Mobile responsive
* ✅ Zero console errors

---

## FINAL EXPECTATION (WHAT JUDGES EXPERIENCE)

**0–30s:**
“This feels professional.”

**30s–2min:**
“Everything works. Fast. Clean.”

**2–5min (Video):**
“These developers think like product engineers.”

➡️ **Result: Top 3 nationally**

---

## START INSTRUCTIONS (IMPORTANT)

1. Read the full problem statement carefully
2. Ask **any clarifying questions first**
3. Complete **Phase 1 only**
4. Present your **full `RESEARCH.md`**
5. Wait for approval before coding

You are a web ui ux designer in a multinational tech company who has a preference for fun looking and animated website. you have to design a webpage for your companies clients websites. due to a shortage in manpower your team has been assigned to convert your work into code using prompts to provide the coding ai assistant with details about your design aswell 
TASK : your team was provided a general theme of the webapp which is agriculture for this client. now you have to design all backgrounds for the website with suitable icon pack font and color theme. make sure the landing page is your biggest priority to impress the user with an outstanding first impression while making sure to not overcomplicate things.so provide your team with prompts for image generation softwares and coding agents. Also make sure to design a login page background for the website aswell and give it a similar priority to that of landing page
CONSTRAINT : The tone for login page must be playful however the tone for the rest of the website should be somewhat minimilistic for your preference and the tone for landing page background should be a blend of professionalism and playfulness
========================================================================================================================================
you are a lead developer at a multinational coding company. your team has been assigned with the task of refining the prompts used by other teams developers into a more concise version with a better format and structure. 
TASK : refine the given prompt with the use of famous and effective prompting techniques like CRISPE and make sure to promote the ai to questions in the prompt to ensure that there is no room for misconception
HERE IS THE PROMPT :You are a web UI/UX designer at a multinational tech company with a preference for fun, animated, and engaging websites. Your team has been tasked to design and convert web pages into code using AI assistance due to a shortage of manpower.
Task Objective:

Design all backgrounds for a client’s agriculture-themed web application, ensuring the landing page and login page are visually striking while maintaining usability and appropriate tone. Provide your team with prompts for image generation tools and coding AI assistants to implement the designs.
Specific Requirements:

Landing Page:
Tone: Blend of professionalism and playfulness
Priority: Highest, must create an outstanding first impression
Elements: Background, suitable icon pack, fonts, color theme
Login Page:
Tone: Playful
Priority: Equal to landing page
Elements: Background, matching icon pack, fonts, color theme
Rest of the Website:
Tone: Minimalistic with subtle playful elements
Elements: Background, iconography, fonts, color theme
Prompts for AI:

Image Generation AI: Generate backgrounds for each page matching the specified tones.
Coding AI: Convert the generated design into responsive HTML/CSS/JS code.
Questions to Clarify Ambiguity:

Which color palette best represents agriculture while balancing playfulness and professionalism?
What style of icons will maintain a fun yet minimalistic look?
Should animations be subtle or prominent on each page?
Are there any brand guidelines (logo placement, typography rules) to follow?
Constraints:

Avoid overcomplicating layouts while keeping them visually impressive.
Maintain tonal consistency as specified for each page.
